Voter-Model-Long-Range-Interactions

This repository contains simulation codes for studying the Voter model on a 2D lattice with long-range interactions. It includes tools to visualize opinion dynamics over time and observe the effects of varying the network size (N) and the proportion of long-range edges (p) on the duration of metastable states (plateaus).
